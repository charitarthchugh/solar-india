Goals:

- Improve the solar plant
  
  - What things matter at a solar plant?
    
    - What things matter for solar cells/panels?
      
      - Efficiency of solar panels
        
           - see [Real Engineering: Mystery flaw of solar panels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVOnHWnLSeU)
        
        - Maximum Sunlight absorption
          
          - Cleaning?
            - maybe need to see a consistent degradation in DC generation through the time period when weather is removed as a factor.
          - Overheating/ High panel temps? 
            - Need to look at module temps and DC generation outputs on days with high ambient temps. Compare efficiency change vs avg.
    
    - Supply to main grid
      
      - DC to AC Conversion
        - Look at losses
          - Find inverters that are performing worse than average. 
          - 3 ways:
            - compare sum of total yields(done already)
            - look at efficiency for each inverter, compare against normal.
            - compare outputs across 1 day.(see Kaggle)
