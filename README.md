# Solar India

An analysis of two solar plants in India, based on the awesome Solar Power Generation   

## Dataset info

Here is the dataset column information, split into two sections- Generation and Weather.  

**Generation Data**

| Field                                | Description                                                                                          |
|:------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATE_TIME`                          | Date and time for each observation. Observations recorded at 15 minute intervals.                    |
| `PLANT_ID`                           | Unique numerical ID for each solar plant.                                                            |
| `SOURCE_KEY` (used as `INVERTER_ID`) | Unique alphanumerical ID for each inverter                                                           |
| `DC_POWER`                           | Amount of DC power generated by the inverter `SOURCE_KEY`, in kilowatts, in this 15 minute interval. |
| `AC_POWER`                           | Amount of AC power generated by the inverter `SOURCE_KEY`, in kilowatts, in this 15 minute interval. |
| `TOTAL_YEILD`                        | This is the total yield for the inverter till that point in time. Does not start at 0.               |

**Weather Data**

| Field                                      | Description                                                                                                                 |
|:------------------------------------------:| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATE_TIME`                                | Date and time for each observation. Observations recorded at 15 minute intervals.                                           |
| `PLANT_ID`                                 | Unique numerical ID for each solar plant.                                                                                   |
| `SOURCE_KEY`   (used as `sensor_panel_id`) | Stands for the sensor panel id. This will be common for the entire file because there's only one sensor panel for the plant |
| `AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE`                      | This is the ambient temperature at the plant.                                                                               |
| `MODULE_TEMPERATURE`                       | There's a module (solar panel) attached to the sensor panel. This is the temperature reading for that module.               |
| `IRRIDATION`                               | Amount of irradiation for the 15 minute interval.                                                                           |
